        The Top Ways to Improve Your Typing{" "}

        Little to No Time

      <div className=" flex flex-col mt-[68px] gap-28">
        <div className=" flex flex-col gap-6">
            <div className=" text-6xl text-white">Make Sure You Sit Comfortable Before You Get Started</div>
            <div className=" text-2xl text-[#B0B0B0]">Before you focus on improving your typing speed by taking the words per minute test, take the time to get situated in a comfortable position. It's harder to type well when standing in place, leaning over the keyboard, or sitting on an uncomfortable chair that causes you to experience back or neck pain. It's far better to sit on a comfortable, supportive chair while maintaining a good posture to increase your comfort before you begin typing away. If you feel good, you can focus more on typing than anything else.</div>
        </div>
        <div className=" flex flex-col gap-6">
            <div className=" text-6xl text-white">Become More Familiarized with the Location of the Letter Keys on the Keyboard</div>
            <div className=" text-2xl text-[#B0B0B0]">If you want to get better at typing quickly and more accurately, it helps to study the keyboard and try remembering where different letters are located. Since the letters aren't in the standard order of A, B, C, D, and so forth, it's a bit tricky at first. However, because of muscle memory, once you get the hang of using the keyboard quite often, your fingers will start remembering the exact location of the different letters. Most keyboards will have the letters in the same spots unless theyâ€™re used for specific reasons, such as gaming, so once you know where they go, you can get the hang of positioning your fingers in the right spots.</div>

        <div className=" flex flex-col gap-6">
            <div className=" text-6xl text-white">Practice Daily with a Convenient English Typing Test</div>
            <div className=" text-2xl text-[#B0B0B0]">Once you've found a comfortable position, start practicing typing while taking a convenient and fun English Typing Test.Once you're on the website, begin typing the words in the box on the screen, focusing more on accuracy than anything else. While you're typing away at the words, the clock is counting down, timing how long it takes you to type out different words within 60 seconds. After the minute passes, you will have the chance to review your words per minute, characters, and accuracy. You will also find out how well your speed is compared to others, whether you're moving at the slower pace of a turtle or a quick speed like a cheetah. The best part about using the typing speed tests is that you can take it as many times as you'd like while improving your skill. You can take the test for hours on end if you feel like it!</div>
        </div>
        <div className=" flex flex-col gap-6">
            <div className=" text-6xl text-white">Try to Improve Your Accuracy Before Focusing Solely on Enhancing Your Speed</div>
            <div className=" text-2xl text-[#B0B0B0]">Don't forget to work on your accuracy before worrying too much about the speed at which you type. It won't matter if you can type 100 words per minute or more if the words don't make much sense. Instead, you should prioritize improving your speed and begin working on receiving higher accuracy so that what you're typing makes sense and isn't grammatically incorrect. The best way to focus on accuracy is to type out the words in front of you without paying too much attention to the clock. The countdown timer is there to give you an idea of how fast you're moving, but it's not something you need to look at or worry about when you want to improve accuracy.</div>

            <div className=" text-2xl text-[#B0B0B0]">Now that you know what it takes to improve your typing skill, speed, and accuracy, take theÂ online Typing testÂ as often as you want and need! If you're serious about becoming an even better typist, it's a good idea to practice in 30-60 minute intervals throughout the day. Try testing yourself first thing in the morning and then later in the evening, especially if you have some free time available.</div>
